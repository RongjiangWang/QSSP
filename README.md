Code for calculating complete synthetic seismograms of a spherical earth using the normal mode theory.

Highlights
(1) all-in-one code for body waves, surface waves, free oscillations, tsunami for uniform ocean, infrasound waves for a standard atmosphere and static deformation
(2) generating Greenâ€™s function database or simulating complete seismograms for any given kinematic source model
(3) hybrid algorithm (numerical integration for low frequency / small harmonic degrees and analytical propagator algorithm for high frequency / large harmonic degrees)
(4) complex frequency technique for supressing the time-domain aliasing problem
(5) differential filter technique for suppressing numerical phases
